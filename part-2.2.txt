Shutting out the world:

	- `andriod.exported="false"` (The exported attribute is used to define if an activity, service, or receiver in your app is accessible and can be launched from an external application.)
	- We need to set andriod.exported to false globally or at each activity level.
	- Remove intent-filter from each activity.


## Part-2.2: Shutting out the world

To shut out the world for the app we need to follow below steps:
1. We need to remove the `<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />` from all activities in AndriodManifest.xml file because that is what allowing the implicit intents.
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/category-element. In another words remove all intent-filters from all activities.

2. Set andriod.exported="false" in all activities.
The android:exported attribute sets whether a component (activity, service, broadcast receiver, etc.) can be launched by components of other applications:

If true, any app can access the activity and launch it by its exact class name.
If false, only components of the same application, applications with the same user ID, or privileged system components can launch the activity.
