# Part 5: Privacy is Important

Our  goal is to remove all privacy invasive code. This is done by removing all metric collecting code,
all areas that needlessly interact with sensors, and all permissions that are not needed for the basic
functionality of the application (buying, browsing, and using gift cards).

## Check for removal of unneeded permissions in Android Manifest

To remove the additional permissiongs for the application we needed to remove `andriod-permissions` from 
AndriodManifest.xml(GiftcardSite/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml).  
Permissions like, android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION are not needed.

To make sure we don't allow other components/apps to call our app intents, we also need to remove all intent-filters
from all activities, or in another words make sure to delete the `Default` category because that is what allows the
external componetns to access the application components. Apart from that we also need to set the `andrioid:exported` to "false"
at all places.

# Check for removal of interaction with sensors

Issue is sensors interact to application back and forth that forward user details back to server
that we dont want to do that so we have removed all the sensor related code from the files 
`GiftcardSite/app/src/main/java/com/example/giftcardsite/ProductScrollingActivity.kt` and `GiftcardSite/app/src/main/java/com/example/giftcardsite/CardScrollingActivity.kt`.

Similarly user location is also being traced by the application so we have removed all location relatd calls and
code block frmo files `ProductScrollingActivity.kt` and `CardScrollingActivity.kt`.

# Check for removal of metric collection API calls

In the app, we are collecting the multiple user activity and data in form of metric.
But we dont want to have those things because we dont want to voilet any data regulation rules.

To fix it, we have removed the UserInterface that is part of `GiftcardSite\app\src\main\java\com\example\giftcardsite\api\service\UserInfo.kt` Interface
and its comsumer conponent `GiftcardSite\app\src\main\java\com\example\giftcardsite\api\model\Reporter`.

We have removed all unnecessary code in (at least) the following files:

AndroidManifest.xml
UserInfo.kt
CardScrollingActivity.kt
ProductScrollingActivity.kt
