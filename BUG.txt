# Part 4: Oops, was that card yours?

## Vulnerability:

There exists a vulnerability in the REST API that allows users to GiftCards that do not belong to them.

## Identifying the cause of the vulnerability

Rest API exposes an endpoint "/api/use/{card_number}" with PUT method, that internally calls useCard method, that takes
a card number and authHeader as input. This endpoint can be used to use a gift card. Now the
issue is, user can use any gift card, even the card that does not belongs to him. The reason behind this issue
is that we only validate the authorization token key and the gift card id. We dont check the mapping of a user identity with a card number
that cause to have gaps where an attacker who had valid token and card number can consume any card that even
does not belong to him. We dont have a authentication mechanism in place in usCard method.

## Potential Solution:

To solve this problem we need to have a relationship mapping of user and its cards. Ideally we should have 
a logic where based on the auth token and card number, we should be able to verify that the requested card
is associated with the user that is trying to use it.

One solution could be using the user token and auth token mapping to know if the card belong to the card cosumer.
Second solution caould be to verify the card's owner id with the current logged in user id,so we can make
sure that this card belons to the current signed user.

Once we have the logic that will make sure we have both authentication and authrization enabled in context of
user id and card number, then we should be good.
