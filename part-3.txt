To enable the encryption in transit for communication, we need to replace the `http` protocol by `https` in all urls used in below files.
1.  SecondFragment.kt
2.  ThirdFragment.kt
3.  CardScrollingActivity.kt
4.  ProductScrollingActivity.kt
5.  UseCard.kt
6.  GetCard.kt
7.  CardRecyclerViewAdapter.kt
8.  RecyclerViewAdapter.kt
